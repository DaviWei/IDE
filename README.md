# Strukture IDE Beta II
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thestrukture/IDE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thestrukture/IDE)

Go lang IDE server. Built with [GopherSauce](http://gophersauce.com)

## About project
The strukture is an open source IDE. It is designed to build web applications, with the organizational help of [GopherSauce](http://gophersauce.com). The IDE runs as a server and is accessed via web browser. Being a web server, the IDE is accessible from any device on your network. Compared to Microsoft's VS Code and Eclipse CHE this IDE is very minimal. It features :
- Web application resource management.
- Autocomplete between different files.
- Syntax correction.
- Server process management.
- Basic terminal via stateless HTTP.
- Line tags in relation to failed build logs.
- Project build scripts.
- View web application output.
- Build docker images (Must have docker running on host) . 

## Requirements
- Go v1.7+. ðŸ˜˜
- [GopherSauce](http://gophersauce.com) if using `makefile`.

## Install

		$ go get github.com/thestrukture/IDE

#### How to run

		$ IDE

#### Launch with GUI (Electron View)

###### Requires NodeJS
- NodeJS [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Change to the ui directory within the root of this package. (Moved ui files to build package as go)

		$ cd ui/
		$ npm install
		$ IDE --headless & npm start

Take note of the pid ID to stop server process. Once your server is up feel free to use `npm start` directly.

### IE Fix
If build commands keep returning the same message, push the `F12` key down to open developer tools and try building again.
